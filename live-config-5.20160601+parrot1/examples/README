live-config-foobar Example
--------------------------

Best practise for downstream projects and derivatives is to ship their custom
live-config components in an own debian package.

The following live-config-foobar example package should be used as a starting
point. The following things should minimally be changed:

  * Replace any mentioning of 'Joe Doe' with your own name.
  * Replace any mentioning of 'example.org' with your own domain name.
  * Replace any mentioning of 'foobar', 'Foobar' and 'FOOBAR' with the name of
    your custom componentsor project name.
